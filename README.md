# What is OpenOptics?

OpenOptics is a general framework for realizing different optical data center network architectures in a plug-and-play manner.
With OpenOptics, users can deploy customized optical data center networks on the testbed, emulation, or simulation with ~10 lines of Python code.
Under the hood, user configurations are converted to control plane programs and deployed to the underlying OCSes and P4 switches.

Supported backends:
- **Mininet** — full software emulation using BMv2 software switches and Mininet networks.
- **Tofino** — deployment on Intel Tofino2 programmable switches (SDE 9.12.0). See [docs/tofino-backend.md](docs/tofino-backend.md).
- **ns-3** — in-process packet-level simulation via ns-3's Python bindings. See [docs/ns3-backend.md](docs/ns3-backend.md).

# Quick Start

OpenOptics has three installation paths — pick the one that matches the backend
you need.

## For the Mininet backend: Docker image + `pip install`

The `ymlei/openoptics:latest` image ships a fully built BMv2, Mininet, and
all native dependencies. Add the Python package on top with pip.

```bash
# If you're on a remote machine, forward the dashboard port first:
ssh -L localhost:8001:localhost:8001 YOUR_MACHINE

# Pull and enter the container:
sudo docker pull ymlei/openoptics:latest
sudo docker run --privileged -dit --network host --name openoptics \
     ymlei/openoptics:latest /bin/bash
sudo docker exec -it openoptics bash

# Inside the container:
pip install "openoptics-dcn[mininet]"
openoptics-gen-examples          # copies ./examples/ into cwd
python3 examples/mininet_routing_direct_perhop.py
```

The dashboard (FastAPI + Uvicorn) starts in-process automatically when your script creates a `BaseNetwork` with `use_webserver=True` (the default).

Then try `h0 ping h1` / `h2 ping h3` inside the OpenOptics CLI.

VS Code Dev Containers also works — Ctrl+Shift+P → "Dev Containers: Reopen in
Container" after `git clone`ing this repo (`.devcontainer/` wires up the same
image).

If you'd rather build the image yourself or install editable from source,
see the [Mininet source-build section in `docs/installation.md`](docs/installation.md#build-mininet-backend-docker-image-manually).

## For the Tofino backend: `pip install` (no Docker)

The Tofino backend only needs Python on your workstation — the heavy
dependencies (Intel SDE, P4 compiler) live on the switches and are invoked
over SSH.

```bash
pip install "openoptics-dcn[tofino]"
openoptics-gen-config            # writes ./openoptics-tofino.toml
# edit the placeholders (USER, jumphost.example.com, IPs, MACs), then run
# a Tofino example — see docs/tofino-backend.md for a full walkthrough.
```

See [docs/tofino-backend.md](docs/tofino-backend.md) for prerequisites and
config details.

## For the ns-3 backend: `pip install` + `openoptics-install-ns3`

The ns-3 backend drives a local ns-3 build via its Python bindings. Our
OpenOptics-specific primitives (OCS, ToR, calendar queue, ...) ship as a
standard ns-3 **contrib module**, and the helper CLI links everything up:

```bash
# one-time system deps (ns-3's own build requirements; Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install git g++ cmake python3-dev python3-setuptools \
                 libgsl-dev libxml2-dev pkg-config

pip install "openoptics-dcn[ns3]"

# clones pinned ns-3 (default ns-3.44), symlinks our contrib module in,
# and runs ./ns3 configure --enable-python-bindings && ./ns3 build
openoptics-install-ns3 ~/ns-3-dev
```

The installer records the chosen ns-3 checkout in `~/.openoptics/ns3_env.json`,
so subsequent OpenOptics scripts pick it up automatically — no shell exports
needed. To use `from ns import ns` directly outside OpenOptics, evaluate the
exports the installer prints (or run `openoptics-install-ns3 --print-env-only ~/ns-3-dev`).

Already have an ns-3 checkout you want to reuse? Pass `--skip-clone`:

```bash
openoptics-install-ns3 --skip-clone /path/to/existing/ns-3-dev
```

The ns-3 backend runs end-to-end for the supported capability envelope
(one host per ToR, traffic-oblivious mode, per-hop and source routing).
Traffic-aware mode and multi-host-per-ToR are in progress. See
[docs/ns3-backend.md](docs/ns3-backend.md) for the full walkthrough of
the install pipeline, contrib-module layout, cppyy Python-binding load
path, and the set of backend-specific kwargs (guardband, link delays,
dashboard cadence, SR `cur_node` verification).

## Bundled resources (all installs)

After `pip install`, these commands seed your working directory:

```bash
openoptics-gen-examples          # examples/
openoptics-gen-tutorials         # tutorials/
openoptics-gen-config            # openoptics-tofino.toml (Tofino config template)
openoptics-install-ns3           # clones + builds ns-3 with our contrib module (ns-3 backend only)
```

# Usage

## With Example Scripts

```
python3 examples/mininet_routing_direct_perhop.py
```
Then you can try ping in your optical DCN,
```
h0 ping h1
h2 ping h3
```

## Defining Your Own Optical DCN with Python APIs

OpenOptics User APIs are located in `openoptics/Toolbox.py`.
This file defines a number of useful functions for creating optical topologies, deploying routing, and monitoring the network.
Every OpenOptics network is a `BaseNetwork` object:

```python
net = Toolbox.BaseNetwork(
    name="my_network",
    backend="Mininet",
    nb_node = 4,
    time_slice_duration_ms = 32, # in ms
    use_webserver=True)
```

You can use `connect(time_slice, node1, node2, port1, port2)` to connect ports of two nodes at the given time slice.
```python
net.connect(node1=0,port1=0,node2=1,port2=0,time_slice=0)
net.connect(node1=2,port1=0,node2=3,port2=0,time_slice=0)
net.connect(node1=0,port1=0,node2=2,port2=0,time_slice=1)
net.connect(node1=1,port1=0,node2=3,port2=0,time_slice=1)
net.deploy_topo()
```

Or you can use provided high-level topology generators:
```python
circuits = OpticalTopo.round_robin(nb_node=8)
net.deploy_topo(circuits)
```
or
```python
circuits = OpticalTopo.opera(nb_node = 8, nb_link=2)
net.deploy_topo(circuits)
```

Next, you can define routing by adding time-flow table entries (as forwarding tables in electrical DCNs) `add_time_flow_entry(node_id, entries, routing_mode)`.
Or use provided high-level routing generators:
```python
paths = OpticalRouting.routing_direct(net.get_topo())
net.deploy_routing(paths, routing_mode="Per-hop")
```

Once you have created a `BaseNetwork` object, and defined its topology and routing, start the network by simply calling `net.start()`.
Now run your Python file and your first optical DCN is deployed!

`net.start()` launches a command line interface defined in `openoptics/OpticalCLI.py`.
This CLI is an extension of Mininet's CLI, with added support for optical DCNs, e.g. to query the number of queued packets in switches and the network's packet loss rate. 

You can find example scripts configuring different architectures under [examples/](examples/) — or, after `pip install`, run `openoptics-gen-examples` to copy them into your current directory.

## Monitor with OpenOptics Dashboard

![OpenOptics Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpi-ncs/openoptics/main/assets/dashboard.png)

The dashboard starts automatically when you create a `BaseNetwork` with `use_webserver=True` (the default) — FastAPI + Uvicorn run in-process on the main Python interpreter, so no separate setup step is needed.
In your web browser, visit http://localhost:8001 to view the dashboard.
The dashboard displays the network topology, along with realtime graphs of network performance served via WebSockets. 

Note: If you're running OpenOptics at a remote machine, make sure to enable port forwarding by passing `-L8001:0.0.0.0:8001` to ssh.
